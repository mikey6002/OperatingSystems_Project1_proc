//my first plan was to make sure it ran correctly without any arguements
then I test my program manually by typing all the flags to see if it works
after that I test each flag one by one to double check that it is working as intentioned. When I was done with that 
I did pid and a pid to makesure that only the info of the pid typed in was showing. 
I wish I knew how to run the testfiles but I have no clue and writing this with very little to no sleep
